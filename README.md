# Object-oriented C++ for Derivatives using Monte Carlo and Finite Differences

This repository contains code examples and exercises from the book "Object-oriented C++ for Derivatives using Monte Carlo and Finite Differences" by Michael L. Halls-Moore. The book provides a comprehensive guide to implementing derivative pricing models using object-oriented programming principles in C++.

## About the Book

The book offers a practical approach to pricing and analyzing financial derivatives using Monte Carlo simulation and finite difference methods. It covers the foundational concepts of derivative pricing, including option theory, stochastic calculus, and numerical methods. With a focus on object-oriented design, the book demonstrates how to build flexible and reusable code for pricing various types of options and calculating risk measures.

## Features

The code examples and exercises in this repository cover the following topics:

1. Basic option pricing models, including Black-Scholes and binomial models.
2. Monte Carlo simulation for pricing complex derivatives.
3. Finite difference methods for solving partial differential equations arising from option pricing.
4. Efficient techniques for accelerating Monte Carlo simulations, such as variance reduction methods.
5. Implementing option Greeks and risk measures for risk management purposes.
6. Building reusable classes and functions for derivative pricing.

## Repository Structure
